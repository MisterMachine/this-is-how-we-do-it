#This is how we do it
## WP Collaborations: Designers, Developers, Clients + Users

With so many of new tools, frameworks, and techniques out there it’s easy to lose focus on just getting a web project up and running. Antonio, Grant, Jesse and Michael have collaborated on designing and developing several projects and they’re here to walk you through what works for them to get a multi-device WordPress website up and running.

We’ll use a website for a small business that needs a custom design as our case-study to talk about:

* Establishing content hierarchy and how that drives a mobile-first design process.
* Tools that reduce barriers and increase collaboration between designers and developers such as Sass, Compass, and creating Pattern Libraries.
* How different roles of a design and development team interact throughout the project.
* Some great back-end techniques like using Vagrant and Capistrano to increase collaboration between developers and speed-up the website deployment.

Finally, we’ll show you how these different roles work together on a successful project and still manage to have a beer at the end of the day together.
